# Hi, I'm Jordi Mas Parramon

I’m a frontend/UI programmer with more than 7 years of experience building fast, clean and ergonomic interfaces using Angular, TypeScript, CSS, JavaScript, jQuery and C#. I’ve also worked across backend, full-stack and Android when needed.

I focus on creating interfaces that are intuitive, accessible and pleasant to use.
Here you’ll find my experience, skills, projects and how to contact me.

I’m currently working on a crisis-management application for Spanish citizens abroad.
